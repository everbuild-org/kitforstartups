# ðŸš€ KitForStartups

_KitForStartups_ is a starter kit for building and shipping fast, secure, and scalable full stack SaaS applications with SvelteKit and TypeScript.

The starter is built and maintained by [Okupter](https://www.okupter.com).

If you already found yourself in a situation where you were:

- Trying to set up various authentication systems (email/password, social logins, OAuth, etc.)
- Scratching your head over how to structure your app
- Spending too much time setting up payments for your SvelteKit app either with Stripe or Lemon Squeezy
- Fighting against your email provider for sending emails from your app, and testing them reliably on your local machine
- Doing all the above again and again for every new project

Then _KitForStartups_ is for you ðŸŽ‰!
